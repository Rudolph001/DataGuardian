### 5. Domain Classification System
- **Purpose**: Categorize recipient domains for security assessment
- **Categories**: Suspicious, Free Email, Business, Government, Financial, Cloud Providers, Social Media, News Media, Educational, Healthcare, Legal, Technology, Non-Profit, Personal, Unknown, Blocked, Whitelisted
- **Features**: Auto-classification, manual overrides, bulk operations
- **Whitelist Feature**: Automatically filters out whitelisted domains during data upload, with persistent storage and management interface

### 6. Data Filtering & Review (Enhanced)
- **Purpose**: Filter and refine email data before security operations
- **Features**: Enhanced UI with professional styling, attachment filtering, wordlist filtering, policy filtering, time period selection
- **Save Functionality**: Moved from Data Upload - users can now save filtered data to JSON after applying filters
- **Workflow**: Filter â†’ Review â†’ Save â†’ Send to Security Operations

### 7. Follow-up Center
- **Purpose**: Track escalated records and manage follow-up actions
- **Integration**: Outlook email template generation
- **Features**: Action tracking, automated email creation

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: CSV files uploaded through Streamlit file uploader
2. **Preprocessing**: Custom parser validates and structures email metadata
3. **Data Filtering**: Enhanced filtering interface with improved UI for refining data
4. **Data Persistence**: Filtered data saved to JSON with date-based organization
5. **Risk Assessment**: Status field determines risk levels for each email
6. **Analysis**: AI and ML algorithms analyze patterns and detect anomalies
7. **Classification**: Domains are automatically categorized based on security policies
8. **Review Process**: Security operations dashboard facilitates manual review
9. **Decision Tracking**: Clear/Escalate decisions are recorded and managed
