# ExfilEye - Data Loss Prevention Email Monitoring System

## Overview

ExfilEye is a comprehensive Streamlit-based Data Loss Prevention (DLP) email monitoring system that provides AI-powered insights, network analysis, and security operations management for email communications. The application focuses on anomaly detection and domain classification to identify potential data exfiltration attempts through email.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
